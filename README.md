# TeamTracker

Team tracker is a web-based solution for keeping track of availability and activity of members of a team. The software is geared towards teams that work in a call-centre type enviroment, with the ability to monitor members' availability on site (in office), on telephone, email and IM. Each team member can set their status for these categories, and can see other members' statuses.

It it intended to provide a dashboard which can allow a team to more effectively allocat work, seek help from available members, and distribute work evenly.

The main interface auto-refreshes on a configurable, regular basis, so can be tailored to display current status data as necessary.
